			<p>As a standard action, you can make an Intimidate check against a hostile target within 30 feet that can clearly see and hear you. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + your opponent&apos;s Hit Dice + its Wisdom modifier. If the target is trained in Sense Motive, the DC is instead equal to 10 + your opponent&apos;s Sense Motive bonus, if higher. If you succeed at this check, the target enters a duel with you.

		<Prerequisites>Cha 15, Persuasive, Diplomacy 5 ranks.</Prerequisites>
		<Benefit>
			<p>While in combat, as a 1-round action (as if it were a spell with a 1-round casting time, you can call for a truce with any creatures that have an Intelligence score of 4 or greater and can understand you. When doing so, you can&apos;t be wielding a weapon or threatening implement, such as a charged spell, wand, or anything else the creatures you are entreating might consider threatening. You must also be in plain sight of most the creatures you are entreating.</p>
			<p>Once you&apos;ve called for a truce, if any of your allies attack or take any threatening action against those you are entreating before the start of your next turn, your call is unsuccessful.</p>
			<p>At the start of your next turn, attempt a single Diplomacy check (DC = 30 + the Charisma modifier of the creature with the highest Charisma modifier in the opposing group). If you are successful, combat ceases for 1 minute, or until any creature in the opposing group is threatened or attacked.</p>
			<p>If you fail the check by 5 or more, you cannot use Diplomacy again with any creature you attempted to entreat for 1d4 hours. If anyone in your group instead plans to use the parley to gain a combat advantage, the opponents can attempt a Sense Motive check against each such member of your group to get a hunch, with a DC equal to either 20 or the result of that character&apos;s Bluff check, whichever is higher.</p>
		</Benefit>
		<Special>
			<p>If the parley would inherently result in the opponents surrendering or losing, if the opponents are mind-controlled or fanatics, or if there are other appropriate circumstances at the GM&apos;s discretion, you might not be able to use this feat. For instance, if the opponents&apos; main advantage over your group comes from a short-duration spell that would end during a parley (see Calling for a Cease-Fire), you cannot use this feat. Circumstances could potentially increase the check&apos;s DC by 5, 10, or even up to 20.</p>

		<Prerequisites>Handle Animal 1 rank, own a figurine of wondrous power. </Prerequisites>
		<Benefit>
			<p>You may select the creature summoned by your figurine of wondrous power as an animal companion or familiar, or as appropriate. The figurine has the standard abilities of a familiar or animal companion of its type, plus additional abilities related to its figurine type (see below). The main advantage of this is that if your familiar or companion is killed in creature form, it merely reverts to statue form and can be used again later.</p>
			<p>The following standard figurines are available as animal companions (C) or familiars (F). </p>
			<p>Ebony Fly (C): You must have the Vermin Heart feat to select this creature as an animal companion. It is treated as a horse animal companion, and at 8th level it gains a fly speed of 120 feet (average maneuverability). </p>
			<p>Golden Lions (C): When you select a golden lion as an animal companion, one of the pair becomes your companion and the other retains its standard figurine abilities. </p>
			<p>Ivory Goats (C): When selecting an ivory goat as an animal companion, you select one of the three goats in the set (traveling, travail, or terror) as your companion; the others remain standard figurines. All three goats are treated as horse animal companions. The goat of traveling never suffers from fatigue or exhaustion from extended travel. The goat of travail has 2 horn attacks (1d8 + Str bonus) in addition to a horse&apos;s normal attacks. The goat of terror has the fear aura and magical weapon horns as described in its figurine entry. </p>
			<p>Marble Elephant (C): The elephant is treated as an elephant companion. </p>
			<p>Serpentine Owl (C, F): The owl is treated as a bird animal companion or an owl familiar, but only in its Small horned owl form. In its giant owl form, it is merely a creature, not an animal companion or familiar. After three uses of its giant owl form, the figurine loses that transformation ability forever but still functions normally in its horned owl form as an animal companion or familiar. </p>
			<p>Silver Raven (C, F): The raven is treated as a bird animal companion or a raven familiar. It retains its metallic appearance and animal messenger ability (though this is redundant for an intelligent familiar) but not its hardness when in animal form. </p>
			<p>While the figurine is active, you and the active figurine gain all the normal benefits of having a companion creature; for example, a wizard with a silver raven familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks, the raven can speak one language, and so on. While the figure is inactive, you gain none of these benefits but are not otherwise hampered by its inert state (as if the creature were out of range but not dead). The usable duration of the companion figurine doubles; for example, an ebony fly is normally usable up to three times per week for up to 12 hours per use, but as a companion creature you may use it up to six times per week for up to 12 hours per use. The figurine is still a magic item and is subject to effects like antimagic field and dispel magic that affect magic items; it uses its caster level or your own, whichever is greater.</p>

		<Benefit>
			<p>When you cast a spell or use a spell-like ability, you can attempt to conceal verbal and somatic components among other speech and gestures, and to conceal the manifestation of casting the spell, so others don&apos;t realize you&apos;re casting a spell or using a spell-like ability until it is too late. The attempt to hide the spell slows your casting slightly, such that spells that normally take a standard action to cast now take a full-round action, and spells that normally take longer than a standard action take twice as long. (Swift action spells still take a swift action.) To discover your ruse, a creature must succeed at a Perception, Sense Motive, or Spellcraft check (the creature receives an automatic check with whichever of those skills has the highest bonus) against a DC equal to 15 + your number of ranks in Bluff or Disguise (whichever is higher) + your Charisma modifier; the creature gains a bonus on its check equal to the level of the spell or spell-like ability you are concealing.</p>
			<p>If your spell has a somatic component, any creature that can see you receives a Perception or Spellcraft check (whichever has the highest bonus) against a DC equal to 15 + your number of ranks in Sleight of Hand + your Dexterity modifier; the creature gains a bonus on its check equal to the level of the spell or spell-like ability you are concealing.</p>
			<p>Since you are concealing the spell&apos;s manifestation through other actions, others observing you realize you&apos;re doing something, even if they don&apos;t realize you&apos;re casting a spell. If there is a verbal component, they still hear your loud, clear voice but don&apos;t notice the spell woven within.</p>
			<p>If an opponent fails its check, your casting also does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and an opponent that fails its check can&apos;t use readied actions that depend on realizing that you&apos;re casting a spell or using a spell-like ability, or readied actions such as counterspelling that require identifying the spell you&apos;re casting. Spells such as fireball that create an additional obvious effect (aside from the manifestation of casting that all spells and spell-like abilities share) still create that effect, though it might not be obvious who cast the spell unless it emanates from you.</p>
			<p>If a character interacts with you long enough to attempt a Sense Motive check without realizing you have been casting spells, that character can use Sense Motive to gain a hunch that you&apos;re behaving unusually.</p>

		<Benefit>
			<p>A contingent spell infuses a target with a dormant healing or restorative spell that can trigger when the target needs it the most. This metamagic feat can be applied to only cure spells; breath of life; or any harmless spell that can be used to remove ability score damage, ability score drain, or a negative condition or effect (including break enchantment, neutralize poison, and remove disease). When you cast a contingent spell, you must set a specific trigger that dictates under what circumstances the target is immediately subject to the spell&apos;s effects (for instance, &apos;When the target dies, breath of life takes effect&apos;). The contingent spell&apos;s effects can remain dormant within the target for up to 10 minutes per caster level you have. A creature can be infused with only one contingent spell at a time.</p>

	You can create construct creatures like golems.
		<Prerequisites>Caster level 5th, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Wondrous Item.</Prerequisites>
		<Benefit>
			<p>You can create any construct whose prerequisites you meet. The act of animating a construct takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its market price. To create a construct, you must use up raw materials costing half of its base price, plus the full cost of the basic body created for the construct. Each construct has a special section that summarizes its costs and other prerequisites. A newly created construct has average hit points for its Hit Dice.</p>
			<p>A homunculus is shaped from a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, spring water, and one pint of the creator&apos;s own blood. These materials cost 50 gp. After the body is sculpted, it is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist&apos;s laboratory, and costing an additional 1,000 gp to supply. If the creator is personally constructing the creature&apos;s body, the building and ritual can be performed together. A homunculus with more than 2 Hit Dice can be created, but each additional Hit Die adds +2,000 gp to the cost to create.</p>
			<p>The person whose blood is used to form a homunculus&apos;s body becomes its master; it is possible for one person to give blood for the creation, another to sculpt the base material, and another to magically animate it as a minion for the one who provided the blood.</p>
			<p>CL 7th; Price 2,050 gp</p>
			<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>
			<p>Feats Craft Construct, arcane eye, mirror image, mending; Skill Craft (leather) or Craft (sculptures) DC 12; Cost 1,050 gp.</p>
			<p>A character with the Craft Construct feat can create homunculi with new abilities in addition to those normally possessed by homunculi.</p>
			<p>To create a homunculus with one or more improvements, the crafter must include large quantities of certain reagents (represented by the price listed for each of the improvements below) while performing the ritual to create a homunculus. For every 1,000 gp worth of additional abilities to be granted to the homunculus, the DC of the Craft check to create the homunculus increases by 1 (minimum +1).</p>
			<p>The crafter can also add new abilities to an existing homunculus by performing a brief surgical procedure. To do so, the crafter must purchase the necessary reagents and make a successful Heal check (DC equal to the DC of the Craft check necessary to create such a homunculus from scratch).</p>
			<p>After encountering constructs firsthand on an adventure, it is only natural that you might want to have such a loyal and potentially powerful ally for yourself. The Craft Construct feat has been a part of the game from the beginning, but the process of crafting a construct, like crafting any magic item, can be confusing. The following section outlines in greater detail the various things to consider when attempting to craft a construct, making the process easier to understand.</p>
			<p>In addition to raw materials, you must supply certain spells to animate a construct, potentially in addition to any other requirements. The exact requirements vary from one construct to another and are included in its construction requirements entry.</p>
			<p>Item Creation Feat: You must have the Craft Construct feat to create a construct. This requirement is mandatory and cannot be avoided unless you have a class feature, feat, or other ability that specifically allows you to do so. Note that because Craft Construct requires both the Craft Magic Arms and Armor and Craft Wondrous Item feats, as well as caster level 5th, these prerequisites will need to be met as well. Some constructs may require you to have one or more additional feats. If these are item creation feats, they are also mandatory.</p>
			<p>Spell Requirements: A construct&apos;s spell requirements are listed in the construction requirements section of the stat block, in alphabetical order. As with other magic items, you must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must know the spells, in the case of spontaneous spellcasters) but need not provide any material components or focuses the spells require. The act of working on the construct expends the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the construct&apos;s creation (that is, those spell slots are expended from the caster&apos;s currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.) For each spell requirement you do not meet, the DC to craft the construct increases by 5.</p>
			<p>Caster Level: Some constructs, especially the more powerful ones, require the creator to be of a certain caster level in order to craft them. Unlike some other crafting requirements, this requirement must be met in order to craft the construct, and cannot be ignored simply by increasing the DC of the skill check to craft the construct by 5.</p>
			<p>Special Requirements: Some constructs have special requirements or restrictions governing their creation.</p>
			<p>Robots, as a general rule, cannot be crafted by player characters, as their construction requires highly specialized and complex technology that is not normally available.</p>
			<p>Other constructs have specific requirements that the caster must meet. As a general rule, unless the description of the construct indicates otherwise, any additional construction requirements other than feats can be bypassed by increasing the DC of the skill check to craft the construct by 5.</p>
			<p>In order to create a construct, you must first gather the necessary materials. This includes both the materials that form the construct&apos;s body and additional materials worth half the base price of the construct. Each construct that can be crafted lists a cost, in gp, in the construction requirements section. This cost includes both the cost of the construct&apos;s body and the cost of the additional materials; this is the full amount that you must pay in order to create the construct.</p>
			<p>The full cost for the construct, including any cost required to provide its body, must be paid before work can begin on the construct.</p>
			<p>Finding Materials: Most of the time, it is assumed that the materials for creating the construct&apos;s body are readily available and can simply be purchased as part of the cost of the construct&apos;s creation. However, depending on the nature of the construct and the materials available at hand, this may not always be the case. Typically, a construct&apos;s entry will describe exactly what its body is made of. If those materials are not readily available for purchase, then you must collect them by some other means, which may involve an adventure run by the GM. Other times, the construct&apos;s body may already be found fully prepared, potentially inspiring the players to attempt to craft a construct of that specific type.</p>
			<p>In this case, the cost for the construct&apos;s body itself does not need to be paid.</p>
			<p>Animating a construct can be a time-consuming process.</p>
			<p>The act of animating a construct takes 1 day for every 1,000 gp in its market price (note that this is different than the cost that must be paid to create the construct). For the purposes of crafting constructs (as well as other magic items), 1 day of work consists of 8 hours of uninterrupted labor, which must occur in a fairly quiet, comfortable, and well-lit place. Certain types of constructs may require specialized equipment or laboratories in order to craft, and in this case, the crafter must have access to these resources and facilities.</p>
			<p>Accelerated Work: You cannot rush the process of crafting a construct by working for more than 8 hours in a given day (even if you do not need to sleep, or are otherwise able to get extra hours out of the day). However, if you increase the DC to create the construct by 5 (a decision that must be made before the crafting process begins), you can accelerate the process to require only 4 hours of work per 1,000 gp in the item&apos;s base price. This allows you to effectively accomplish 2 days&apos; worth of work in a single day, or finish the construct in the same number of days by spending less time on it each day.</p>
			<p>Dangerous Conditions: If you are not able to fully focus on your work, it takes much longer to accomplish. Characters attempting to craft in distracting or dangerous conditions, such as a crafter who is working while out adventuring, do so at a much slower pace. You can devote only 4 hours per day to item creation while adventuring or in similar conditions, and you work at half the normal pace (so you complete only 2 hours of work that day).</p>
			<p>Intermittent Creation: You do not need to continue working on crafting a construct nonstop until you finish it. While each 8-hour (or 4-hour) block of time spent on crafting must be continuous, once those hours have been spent, you can stop work to pursue other activities as you see fit. You can leave a project partially finished for days, weeks, or even months, not making any progress toward its completion, without impacting the crafting process (provided you do not start crafting something else; see Simultaneous Creation below).</p>
			<p>Simultaneous Creation: You can work on only one item at a time. If you start work on a new item, all materials used on the previous item (as well as all progress made on it) are wasted. This applies to all magic items, not just constructs, so for example if you are working on a crafting a stone golem and take a break to craft a hat of disguise, the materials and progress put towards the stone golem will be lost.</p>
			<p>Crafting a construct isn&apos;t easy, and not everyone is able to do it. Simply spending time and money does not make the construct spring into existence. Instead, the crafter must succeed at a skill check in order to successfully craft the construct. The skill check is not attempted until the very end of the process, once you have spent the required time working on the construct.</p>
			<p>Skill Type: The exact skills that can be used to craft a particular construct are given in its construction requirements and vary from one construct type to another. As a general rule, most constructs require a Craft skill of some kind, although some may allow other skills (such as the flesh golem, which can be created with Heal). Most constructs list more than one possible skill, and you can choose which of these skills to use when making the check.</p>
			<p>DC: The DC of the skill check to craft a construct is located in its construction requirements and varies from one construct type to another. Generally speaking, the DC is equal to 5 + the default caster level of the construct. Beyond this base DC, several modifiers can increase the DC.</p>
			<p>Accelerated Crafting: When you begin crafting a construct, you can choose to work at an accelerated pace. This halves the amount of time required to create the construct but increases the DC of the skill check to create the construct by 5.</p>
			<p>Unmet Prerequisites: As with creating any other magic item, there are certain prerequisites that are mandatory (such as the item creation feat) and others that are optional (such as the spell requirements). For each optional component that you fail to meet, the DC to create the construct increases by 5.</p>
			<p>Failure: If you fail the skill check to craft the construct by less than 5, the attempt fails, and the materials and time spent crafting the construct are wasted. Normally, if a character fails a check to create a magic item by 5 or more, the result is a cursed item. At the GM&apos;s discretion, if a player fails a check to create a construct by 5 or more, the results may be more dire&#x2014;the magic animating the construct might fail spectacularly and result in a damaging explosion, or the resulting construct could be uncontrolled and violent.</p>
			<p>Once the crafting process is complete, the resulting construct is ready to receive orders. A construct recognizes its creator intuitively and obeys all commands issued to it by that individual.</p>
			<p>Hit Points: A newly created construct has the average hit points for its Hit Dice. When a construct is created, it has full hit points and is not damaged.</p>
			<p>Feats and Skills: Most constructs are mindless, and so they do not have feats or skills. However, a small number of constructs have an Intelligence score, and their creator determines what feats and skill ranks the construct has when it is created. This choice cannot later be changed.</p>
			<p>Besides the normal method of crafting a construct from scratch, there are several ways that you can potentially go about gaining possession of a construct.</p>
			<p>Golem Manuals: The wondrous items known as golem manuals contain all the information and magical power required to create a particular kind of golem. This effectively grants the Craft Construct feat to anyone using the manual to craft a golem of that type, and it provides an increase in caster level for the purpose of meeting the prerequisite to craft that specific type of golem. Further, the manual grants a +5 competence bonus on skill checks to craft the golem and contains all the necessary spells, which can be activated by anyone who has the relevant spells on their class&apos;s spell list (but only for the purpose of crafting the golem). When using a golem manual, you must still spend the normal amount of time to craft the golem and pay the cost of the golem&apos;s body (or provide it through other means), but you do not need to pay the rest of the normal cost to create the golem.</p>
			<p>For example, with a clay golem manual, you would need to provide a body worth 1,500 gp (rather than the normal full cost of 21,500 gp), spend 42 days constructing the golem&apos;s body (1 for each 1,000 gp in the normal price of the golem), have a caster level of 9th or higher (as the manual provides a +2 bonus and the normal requirement is 11th level), have animate objects, bless, commune, prayer, and resurrection on your class&apos;s spell list, and succeed at a DC 16 Craft (sculptures) or Craft (pottery) check (but the manual gives you a +5 bonus on the check.)</p>
			<p>Purchasing a Construct: Rather than go through all the hassle of building a construct from scratch, you can always allow someone else to do all of the work for you and simply purchase the results. of course, this can be quite expensive, as a great deal of time and energy goes into the creation of constructs, and those who are skilled enough to craft them generally charge a premium for their services. Any construct that can be crafted has a market price, which is usually fairly close to twice the cost to craft the construct. Purchasing a construct follows the same rules as purchasing other magic items, meaning that for particularly powerful and expensive constructs, a prospective buyer might need to travel to a sufficiently large city.</p>
			<p>Stealing a Construct: Generally speaking, constructs are quite difficult to steal, being large and heavy. More to the point, stealing them is not terribly effective unless you have a way to control them. One option is the spell control construct, which can grant a limited ability to hijack a construct. By using the spell to bring the construct to a desired location and giving it a final command before the spell ends, you can set the construct to guard a desired spot or direct it to simply wait for you to cast control construct on it again the next time you want to give it orders. of course, if the construct&apos;s true owner is able to track it down or you lose control of the construct, you might find the stolen construct turned against you!</p>
			<p>Presented here are new construct modifications that can be used to alter or enhance existing constructs so that they are suited to particular purposes.</p>
			<p>These modifications are used to alter a construct&apos;s basic properties: movement speed, resistances, senses and spell-like abilities.</p>
			<p>Movement Modification: This modification improves a construct&apos;s existing movement. This modification can improve a construct&apos;s land speed, increasing the speed by 10 feet, up to a total speed equal to double its original land speed. Each 10-foot improvement costs 2,000 gp. Constructs with a climb or swim speed can improve these speeds by 10 feet, up to a total speed equal to double the original speed, at a cost of 3,000 gp per 10-foot improvement. Constructs with a fly speed can improve these speeds by 10 feet, up to a total speed equal to double the original speed, at a cost of 4,000 gp per 10-foot improvement.</p>
			<p>Constructs can also gain new means of locomotion with this modification. A construct can gain a climb or swim speed of 15 feet at a cost of 6,000 gp. A construct can gain a fly speed of 15 feet at a cost of 8,000 gp so long as it has at least 5 Hit Dice. A Tiny or smaller construct gains a maneuverability of good, a Medium or Small construct gains a maneuverability of average, a Large or Huge construct gains a maneuverability of poor, and Gargantuan or larger constructs gain a maneuverability of clumsy.</p>
			<p>Resistances: This modification grants resistances to a construct or improves existing resistances. The construct gains energy resistance 5 to one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. This base resistance costs 4,000 gp. This modification can also improve resistance to the above energy types, up to a total equal to double the original value or 15, whichever is lower. Improving energy resistance in this way costs 6,000 gp for every increment of 5 by which the resistance is increased. Constructs with vulnerability to one of the above energy types, such as an ice golem&apos;s vulnerability to fire, cannot gain resistance to that energy type with this modification.</p>
			<p>Sense Modification: This modification improves the construct&apos;s existing senses. This modification can improve a construct&apos;s darkvision, extending the range of that darkvision by an additional 30 feet, up to a total range of 120 feet. Each improvement costs 2,500 gp. This modification can also provide blindsense and blindsight to a construct. Blindsense can be added at a cost of 4,000 gp per 30 feet of blindsense, up to a total of 60 feet of blindsense. Blindsight can be added to a construct with blindsense at a cost of 7,500 gp per 15 feet of blindsight, up to a total of 30 feet of blindsight.</p>
			<p>Spell-Like Ability Modification: This modification allows a construct to cast a spell-like ability in a limited capacity. A spell-like ability chosen for this modification can be of any level, but it must be one that the construct&apos;s creator can cast. The construct can cast the selected spell-like ability once per day. Using this modification, a construct&apos;s creator can provide additional castings of the same spell-like ability by paying the cost for that spell multiple times. For example, a construct can gain the ability to cast fireball three times per day if the creator pays for the cost of the spell-like ability three times. A construct&apos;s Hit Dice limit the total amount of spell-like abilities it can gain from this modification. A construct can gain only a number of spell levels through this modification up to a total equal to its Hit Dice. Following the above example, the construct requires at least 9 Hit Dice to cast fireball three times per day. The cost for adding a spell like ability is equal to 3,000 gp per spell level of the spell. For the purposes of this cost, a 0-level spell has a spell level of 1/2.</p>
			<p>These modifications represent more complex changes to the structure and function of the construct; each has specific requirements, a cost equivalent to the minimum level to cast the spell &#xD7; the spell level &#xD7; 250 gp, and a potential increase to the construct&apos;s CR.</p>
			<p>Requirements Craft Construct; Spells alarm</p>
			<p>CR Increase none; Cost 250 gp</p>
			<p>This modification allows a construct to alert its creator with a mental alarm. The creator sets a specific password for the construct. Any creature it encounters that does not speak the password within 1 round causes the construct to activate the mental alarm, which alerts the creator so long as the creator is within 1 mile. The mental alarm awakens the creator from non-magical sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration.</p>
			<p>The creator can deactivate or reactivate a construct&apos;s alarm feature as a standard action. The maximum distance of the mental alarm can be increased by paying an additional 250 gp for each additional mile of maximum distance.</p>
			<p>Requirements Craft Construct, Craft Wondrous Item, mage&apos;s private sanctum, Small or larger construct</p>
			<p>CR Increase none; Cost 11,250 gp</p>
			<p>This modification allows a construct to transform into a shelter capable of housing its creator and her allies. The transformation is a rigorous process that requires 10 minutes to complete. Once transformed, the shelter can house a number of inhabitants based on the construct&apos;s size. A Colossal construct can house one Colossal creature, two Gargantuan creatures, four Huge creatures, eight Large creatures, 16 Medium creatures, or 32 Small creatures. A Gargantuan construct can house one Gargantuan creature, two Huge creatures, four Large creatures, eight Medium creatures, or sixteen Small creatures, and so forth. A construct shelter does not have any accommodations beyond the basics required to rest.</p>
			<p>Creatures within the shelter can see out, but creatures outside cannot see into the shelter.</p>
			<p>The construct can still receive orders and can eject a creature or prevent a creature from entering according to its creator&apos;s orders. A creature can avoid being ejected with a successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + the construct&apos;s CR). A creature that attempts to enter the shelter must attempt to break through with a Strength check opposed by the construct&apos;s Strength check, forcing its way into the shelter on a success. Alternatively, a creature seeking entry can attack the shelter. The shelter always has an AC of 10, but it retains any damage reduction or hardness the construct has. The attacker must deal damage equal to one-quarter the construct&apos;s total hit points to gain entry, reducing the construct&apos;s hit points by an equivalent amount.</p>
			<p>Requirements Craft Construct, Craft Wondrous Item; Spells secret chest, Small or larger construct</p>
			<p>CR Increase none; Cost 11,250 gp</p>
			<p>This modification creates an extradimensional space within the construct, allowing the creator and her allies to store objects within the construct. The construct&apos;s size determines the amount of storage available. A Small construct contains 4 cubic feet of space that can hold up to 25 pounds. This space and weight limit is doubled for each size category larger than Small, up to a total of 128 cubic feet and a weight limit of 800 pounds for a Colossal construct. The construct can retrieve any object held within this space as a swift action. Other creatures accessing this space can retrieve an object as a move action. This extradimensional space otherwise functions like a bag of holding.</p>
			<p>Requirements Craft Construct, telepathy</p>
			<p>CR Increase none; Cost 16,500 gp</p>
			<p>This modification allows a creator to issue orders to its construct via a mental connection. The creator must be within 100 feet of the construct to issue orders in this way. Unintelligent constructs and constructs unable to communicate can receive orders but not respond through this mental connection.</p>
			<p>Requirements Craft Construct; Spells make whole</p>
			<p>CR Increase +1; Cost 1,500 gp</p>
			<p>This modification allows a construct to use some of the innate magic that powers its body to repair damage to itself. As a swift action, the construct can gain fast healing 5. A construct can activate this fast healing for a number of rounds per day equal to half its Hit Dice (minimum 1 round). These rounds do not need to be consecutive. A construct can gain this modification multiple times. Each time, the total number of rounds per day increases by a number equal to half the construct&apos;s Hit Dice (minimum 1 round), up to a maximum equal to double the construct&apos;s Hit Dice. Constructs that already have the fast healing ability instead increase their fast healing value by 2, up to a maximum equal to double the construct&apos;s original fast healing value.</p>
			<p>Requirements Craft Construct; Spells fireball</p>
			<p>CR Increase +1; Cost 3,750 gp</p>
			<p>This modification causes a construct to explode in a shower of razor-sharp scrap and debris when it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. All creatures within a 10-foot burst of the construct take a number of points of slashing damage equal to 1d6 times the construct&apos;s CR. A successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the construct&apos;s Hit Dice + the construct&apos;s Constitution modifier) halves this damage. If a construct already has a similar ability, such as the death burst of a clockwork golem, the DC of the ability instead increases by 4.</p>

	<Bundle id="Craft Ooze" title="Craft Ooze" groups="Item Creation" description="You can use alchemy to create dangerous ooze creatures.">
		<Prerequisites>Brew Potion, Craft Wondrous Item, Craft (alchemy) 3 ranks, caster level 5th.</Prerequisites>
		<Benefit>
			<p>You can create living oozes as though they were magical items. Creating an ooze creature takes 1 day for each 500 gp in its construction cost. To create an ooze, you must have access to an oozing vat (see below), you must use up raw materials worth the construction cost of the ooze, and you must succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check (DC 10 + 2 &#xD7; the ooze&apos;s CR). A failed check ruins the materials used, while a check that fails by 5 or more also results in an ooze that attacks its creator for 1d4 rounds before dissipating into useless waste material. A newly created ooze has average hit points for its Hit Dice. Oozes created with this feat are mindless and uncontrolled, and even normally intelligent oozes like slithering trackers that are created this way have no Intelligence score&#x2014;nor any loyalty to their creator.</p>
			<p>While ooze creatures cannot normally be purchased in traditional marketplaces, GMs who wish to include such an option in their games&#x2014;perhaps with oozes sold as black market commodities&#x2014; need only double the construction cost of a specific ooze creature in order to figure out a fair market price.</p>
			<p>The following table lists some of the most commonly crafted oozes and their creation requirements. At the GM&apos;s discretion, other types of ooze creatures can be created with this feat.</p>

		<Prerequisites>Craft (jewelry) 5 ranks, caster level 5th.</Prerequisites>
		<Benefit>
			<p>You can create special wondrous items&#x2014;typically barbs, hooks, rings, and spikes&#x2014;that adorn piercings in the wearer&apos;s flesh and grant magical abilities. Both you and the recipient of the piercing (if not yourself) must be present for the entire piercing process.</p>
			<p>Shadow piercings must be placed in a part of the body normally associated with a magic item slot, but they do not take up a slot on the body, nor interfere with other magic items that use those slots. A single slot can only hold one shadow piercing (non-magical piercings do not count against this limit). Shadow piercings can be applied to the following slots: belt, body, chest, eyes, feet, hands, head, neck, shoulder, and wrist.A single slot can hold multiple physical piercings, though the pieces of jewelry operate as a single item and must be created for that purpose. Shadow piercings have different levels of power: minor, major, and greater. Minor shadow piercings usually include one piece of jewelry, while major and greater shadow piercings often are made up of multiple rings and spikes that cover the entire area of the piercing&apos;s slot (but are still considered a single item). A creature can only use a number of shadow piercings equal its Constitution modifier plus its Wisdom modifier.Carefully inserting or removing a shadow piercing takes a full-round action and deals no damage. Alternatively, a shadow piercing may be pulled out of a creature using the steal maneuver as a standard action that deals 1d6 points of damage. Only a creature with the Craft Shadow Piercing feat may create or insert a shadow piercing, but any creature may remove one. Inserting a shadow piercing is impossible unless the target is willing or helpless. After being removed, a shadow piercing may be inserted into another creature by someone with this feat. Since they are treated as magic items, they are affected by dispel magic.Shadow piercings follow the rules for magic item creation, except the creator can use the Craft (jewelry) skill instead of Spellcraft. New shadow piercings can be researched and designed using the rules for pricing new magic items. Shadow piercing powers for a specific slot must be thematically similar or linked. Since shadow piercings don&apos;t interfere with other magic items in the same slot, but can only have one piercing per slot, the base price is multiplied by 1.5 instead of doubled as if they had no space limitation.</p>

		<Benefit>
			<p>Once per day, when you clear your mind to regain spell slots, you can create a sanguine elixir. When you do, pick one of your bloodline powers. You transfer that power into a small potion that any creature can drink to temporarily gain the benefit of your bloodline power. Creating a sanguine elixir takes 1 hour, and requires special oils and distillates worth 100 gp, and when you make the sanguine elixir, you lose access to the bloodline power until the next time you clear your mind to regain spell slots. When a creature drinks a sanguine elixir, it can activate the bloodline power anytime before the end of its next turn, as if it had access to that bloodline power. A creature that drinks the elixir cannot gain the benefit if its character level does not equal or exceed the minimum level of the bloodline power. Any level-dependent effects use the character level of the creature that drinks the sanguine elixir, or your sorcerer level, whichever is lower. Drinking a sanguine elixir is just like drinking a potion. A sanguine elixir is treated as a magic item with your caster level.</p>

			<p>You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged weapon, you may deflect it so that you take no damage from it. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged attack doesn&apos;t count as an action. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects can&apos;t be deflected.</p>
			<p>Editor&apos;s Note</p>
			<p>Does an attack that is &apos;deflected&apos; count as a miss?</p>
			<p>It depends on the ability that is deflecting the attack.</p>
			<p>For example, the Deflect Arrows feat says, &apos;Once per round when you would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged weapon, you may deflect it so that you take no damage from it.&apos; It doesn&apos;t say the attack is a miss or is treated as a miss&#x2014;instead, you take no damage from the attack. Because it is not a miss, effects that would trigger on a miss (such as Efreeti Style or Snake Fang) are not triggered.</p>
			<p>Likewise, the Crane Wing feat uses similar language and does not say the deflected attack is a miss or treated as a miss.</p>
			<p>Note that the Snatch Arrows feat counts as a deflected attack&#x2014;you do not take damage if you choose to catch the weapons instead of just deflecting it, and catching the weapon does not mean the attack was a miss.</p>
			<p>Update: If the attack is deflected, not only does the target take no damage, but any other effects (ability drain, negative levels, harmful conditions, and so on) associated with that attack do not occur. If the deflected attack is a touch spell or other effect that requires &apos;holding the charge,&apos; the charge is not expended. For example, if a ghoul&apos;s claw attack is deflected, the target is not subject to the ghoul&apos;s paralysis ability from the attack. If a shocking grasp touch attack is deflected, the attacker is still &apos;holding the charge.&apos;</p>
			<p>[Source]</p>
			<p>How does Deflect Arrows work with Manyshot?</p>
			<p>Deflect Arrows works only once per round. Manyshot allows an archer to shoot multiple arrows, but you only make one attack roll, so Deflect Arrows would block all arrows grouped in anyone particular Manyshot attack.</p>

A delayed blast radiates an aura of magic appropriate for its spell level even while it is delayed, and during that time, it can be dispelled by dispel magic.</p>

		<Benefit>
			<p>A delayed spell can be activated as a standard action anytime within 1 minute per spell level of being cast. Only spells that target one or more squares or grid intersections can be affected by Delayed Spell, and the target (as well as any other variables determined at the time of casting) cannot be changed once the delayed spell is cast. You can have as many delayed spells as you wish at any given time, but only one spell can be triggered in a single standard action. Though a delayed spell does not manifest until it is triggered, it emits a magical aura as normal and can be identified with Knowledge (arcana) as a spell effect in place.</p>
