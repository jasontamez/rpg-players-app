			<p>Your familiar must be able to speak to cast spells with a verbal component (the ability to speak with its master or creatures of its kind is insufficient). Your familiar must be carrying any material or focus components necessary, unless the materials cost less than 1 gp and the spell is prepared with Eschew Materials. Attack rolls use your familiar&apos;s ability scores. A familiar spell counts against the number of spells you may prepare for as long as your familiar retains the spell. Once your familiar casts a retained spell, you can prepare a new spell in that slot the next time you prepare spells.</p>
			<p>A familiar spell uses up a spell slot 3 levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level. Your familiar can store a number of spell levels (including this modifier) equal to your caster level, but no spell&apos;s adjusted level can exceed half your caster level.</p>

			<p>For example, if you are raging, have a raging Constitution score of 18, are currently at 2 hit points, and take 20 hit points of damage from a hit (which is enough to bring you to &#x2013;18 hit points, thereby killing you), you may spend 1 round of rage to reduce the damage by 1 hit point (leaving you perilously close to death at &#x2013;17 hit points); if you spend 17 rounds of rage, you reduce the damage to 1 (the minimum), leaving you with 1 hit point.Note: If this damage still makes you fall unconscious, your rage ends just like it normally would, lowering your Constitution to its normal value and reducing your hit point total as normal. Therefore, it is possible to use this feat to prevent yourself from instantly dying, yet you still die because your negative hit points exceed your normal Constitution score&#x2014;take your normal Constitution into account when deciding how many rounds of rage to spend with this feat.</p>

			<p>You can create fleshwarped creatures and fleshcraft grafts. A newly created fleshwarped creature has average hit points for its Hit Dice.</p>
			<p>A creature with the Fleshwarper feat can also create fleshcraft elixirs. Doing so requires an alchemy lab worth at least 1,000 gp as well as 1 pound of living tissue per 1,000 gp value of the elixir, just like creating a graft, but the components are distilled into the elixir. Creating a fleshcraft elixir is like creating a magic item and requires 1 day of crafting time per 1,000 gp of the graft&apos;s value. These potionlike concoctions can bestow the effect of an individual fleshcraft graft (a creature can&apos;t benefit from more than one at a time), but for a limited period of time. Imbibing a fleshcraft elixir works similarly to imbibing other potions or elixirs, except that it&apos;s slow acting, taking effect the round after it is imbibed (as if the imbiber were casting a 1-round casting time spell). Fleshcraft elixirs are foul and potentially dangerous.</p>
			<p>A fleshcraft elixir is keyed to a specific type of fleshcraft, and each elixir provides a Fortitude save that the imbiber must succeed at in order to gain that graft&apos;s effect for the limited duration.</p>
			<p>On a failed saving throw, the imbiber gains only the graft&apos;s penalty for its duration, and if the imbiber fails the saving throw by 5 or more, the imbiber also takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage. While not strictly magical (and not applicable for reuse with alchemical allocation), they count as both transmutation and poison effects that affect only living creatures for the purposes of saving throws and resistances.</p>
			<p>Below are some examples of fleshcrafts. In addition to the name, slot, and effect, each fleshcraft presents information for both the elixir and the graft versions. Each category of information is explained below.</p>
			<p>Temporary Duration: This is the length of time the fleshcraft lasts if the recipient is merely imbibing a fleshcraft elixir for its limited effects. This does not apply to a permanent fleshcraft such as a graft. If the graft has a limited number of uses per day, a creature affected by its corresponding elixir can use the ability the same number of times during the elixir&apos;s duration.</p>
			<p>Saving Throw: This is the DC of the Fortitude saving throw the imbiber must succeed at to gain the benefits rather than just the penalties of the fleshcraft when imbibing a fleshcraft elixir. A creature imbibing a corresponding elixir that fails this saving throw by 5 or more also takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage.</p>
			<p>Penalty This is the penalty that a creature takes while benefiting from a fleshcraft graft or elixir, or takes if it fails the saving throw after imbibing a fleshcraft elixir.</p>

			<p>You can attempt a Craft or Heal check to craft a special type of trophy called an ornament from part of a creature that&apos;s been dead for less than an hour. You take a &#x2013;4 penalty on this check if you or an ally didn&apos;t slay the creature. You can craft one ornament per character level per day. Each corpse provides enough material for one ornament plus one additional ornament per size category above Medium. You can wear one ornament in each magic item slot not already occupied by another item. When you craft an ornament, you choose whether it affects Armor Class, attack rolls, CMB, CMD, saving throws, or skill checks. The ornament provides a morale bonus equal to the monster&apos;s CR divided by 4 (round down, minimum 1) to the selected statistic against creatures of the same creature type as the source of the ornament. This bonus increases by 1 against creatures of the exact same variety (so a red dragon&apos;s talon provides the increased bonus against red dragons but not all dragons). An ornament remains effective for 1 day, plus 1 additional day for every 5 by which you exceed the DC to craft it. You can give ornaments to others, but gifted ornaments have a morale bonus equal to the monster&apos;s CR divided by 6 (round down, minimum 0) and remain effective for only 24 hours.</p>

	<Bundle id="Grow Plant Creature" title="Grow Plant Creature" groups="Item Creation" description="Through careful study and communion with nature, you have learned how to cultivate and raise plant creatures.">
		<Prerequisites>Train Plants, Handle Animal 5 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks.</Prerequisites>
		<Benefit>
			<p>You can grow plants and perform rituals to invest them with animating spirits, becoming assassin vines, treants, or viper vines. Each plant creature has a list of additional prerequisites, costs, and skill checks required to grow them (see Growing Plant Creatures below). At the GM&apos;s discretion, characters with this feat may grow other plant creatures as well.</p>
			<p>The process of growing a plant companion is very similar to the process of growing a leshy. The creator begins by growing an array of especially verdant plants, and then performs rituals to have a spirit of nature inhabit it. Typically, the creator is a powerful druid, but anyone capable of making the required Knowledge checks and casting the required spells may attempt the process.Cultivated minions closely resemble more familiar plant creatures&#x2014; and share the same stat blocks&#x2014;but are approximated copies woven from horticulture and magic.An &apos;assassin vine&apos; cultivated by a druid using the Grow Plant Creature feat isn&apos;t a true assassin vine, and the seeds it produces would sprout into mundane ivy, grape vines, or similar vines originally used to construct it. At the GM&apos;s discretion, this may allow druids to grow plant minions with special abilities, such as a peach treant who produces fruit or a viper vine woven from stinging nettles whose touch causes burning welts. Such adjustments should always increase the cost to create a plant creature, and should adjust their challenge rating if they greatly expand the minion&apos;s combat abilities or utility.Growing a plant creature takes 2 weeks per Hit Die, during which the creator must fertilize, water, and protect the growth. During this period, the creator must use certain rare nutrients and fertilizer to prime the transformation from a normal plant into a plant creature&#x2014;the cost of these components varies according to the type, but is never less than 1,000 gp per Hit Die.The cultivator must succeed at a Knowledge (nature) check at this time in order to properly form the plant body&#x2014;the exact check as well as the required DC varies according to the creature. If the check fails, the plant withers and dies and the cultivator must begin anew.If the skill check is successful, the cultivator must then perform a 24-hour awakening ritual. During this ritual, the cultivator must cast the spells detailed in each individual creature&apos;s entry. At the awakening ritual&apos;s climax, there is a flat 50% chance that the attempt to create the creature succeeds&#x2014;if this final check fails, no appropriate spirit is close enough to answer the call. The plant body becomes dormant, and remains so for 3 months. After this time, another awakening ritual can be performed (requiring another 1,000 gp of materials); this new ritual also has a flat 50% chance of success. At the GM&apos;s discretion, the awakening ritual&apos;s chance for success might increase to 75% or even 100% in natural and unspoiled environments appropriate to the individual creature. Discovering such a rare and magical site should be the focus of its own adventure. If the awakening ritual is successful, the creature awakens fully formed. A freshly created plant creature is under no particular compulsion to obey its creator, but most regard their makers as friends and allies.Plant creatures are particularly adept at growing other plant creatures of the same type. Sentient creatures of the plant type gain a +5 racial bonus on their Knowledge (nature) checks to cultivate other plant creatures, halve the time required to grow the creature, and reduce the materials cost by 25%. A plant creature improves the success chance of any awakening ritual it personally performs by 5% per Hit Die it possesses.At the GM&apos;s discretion, it may be possible to create plant creatures with more Hit Dice than normal. Each additional Hit Die adds 2,250 gp to the cost of creating it (and thus 4,500 gp to the overall price), increases the DC of the Knowledge check by 2, and requires an additional 2 weeks of growth.</p>

			<p>Whenever you encounter a recently neutralized haunt, the remains of an incorporeal undead creature, or the remains of a creature that has the ability to possess another creature using a racial spell-like ability or supernatural ability (such as a ghost or a shadow demon), you can attempt to extract material components from those remains that are suitable for crafting magic items.

			<p>After 10 minutes, the components have degraded too much to be of any use to you.</p>
			<p>Harvesting components with this feat can take several hours. Performing at least 1 minute of work extracting components from a haunt or creature prevents its material components from degrading further for 24 hours, allowing you to safely suspend and resume harvesting these components without fear of subsequent degradation. This ectoplasmic residue is portable once the extraction work begins, provided you have a vial to contain the source residue (the actual amount of residue is never much, physically, but the value of the components you can extract from the residue increases with the power of the original haunt or creature).</p>
			<p>Each hour, attempt a Craft (alchemy) or a Knowledge (religion) check to successfully handle the residue and extract useful material. The DC for this check is equal to 15 + the CR of the haunt or creature being harvested.</p>
			<p>If you succeed at the check, you harvest 50 gp worth of components. If you fail the check by 4 or less, you can attempt to harvest those components again.</p>
			<p>If you fail the check by 5 or more, the residue spoils and you cannot scavenge any more from that particular source. A single source can yield an amount of components up to a maximum value of 50 gp per point of CR before it is depleted.</p>
			<p>Material components harvested with Haunt Scavenger can be used in place of the material components of enchantment or necromancy spells and extracts, provided they are of equal or greater value compared to the spell&apos;s normal material components.</p>
