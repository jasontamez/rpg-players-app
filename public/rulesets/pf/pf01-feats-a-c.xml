			<p>Select one advanced armor training option.</p>
		</Benefit>
		<Special>
			<p>This feat can be taken more than once, but at most once per 3 fighter levels.</p>
		</Special>
	</Bundle>
	<Bundle id="Advanced Weapon Training" title="Advanced Weapon Training" groups="Combat" description="You are specially trained to use your weapon skills in new ways.">
		<Prerequisites>Fighter level 5th, weapon training class feature.</Prerequisites>
		<Benefit>
			<p>Select one advanced weapon training option, applying it to one fighter weapon group you have already selected with the weapon training class feature.</p>
		</Benefit>
		<Special>
			<p>This feat can be taken more than once, but at most once per 5 fighter levels.</p>
			<p>Fighters that have the weapon master archetype can select this feat beginning at 4th level. The benefits of a weapon master&apos;s advanced weapon training options apply only to his selected weapon rather than all weapons in the same fighter weapon group, and he can&apos;t select the weapon specialist advanced weapon training option. A weapon master can select this feat as a bonus feat; if he does so, it doesn&apos;t count for the purpose of the requirement that it can be taken at most once per 5 fighter levels.</p>
			<p>If an archetype replaces a class ability with a more specific version of that ability (or one that works similarly to the replaced ability), does the archetype&apos;s ability count as the original ability for the purpose of rules that improve the original ability?</p>
			<p>It depends on how the archetype&apos;s ability is worded. If the archetype ability says it works like the standard ability, it counts as that ability. If the archetype&apos;s ability requires you to make a specific choice for the standard ability, it counts as that ability. Otherwise, the archetype ability doesn&apos;t count as the standard ability. (It doesn&apos;t matter if the archetype&apos;s ability name is different than the standard class ability it is replacing; it is the description and game mechanics of the archetype ability that matter.)</p>
			<p>Example: The dragoon (fighter) archetype (Ultimate Combat) has an ability called &apos;spear training,&apos; which requires the dragoon to select &apos;spears&apos; as his weapon training group, and refers to his weapon training bonus (even though this bonus follows a slightly different progression than standard weapon training). Therefore, this ability counts as weapon training for abilities that improve weapon training, such as gloves of dueling (Advanced Player&apos;s Guide), which increase the wearer&apos;s weapon training bonus.</p>
			<p>Example: The archer (fighter) archetype gets several abilities (such as &apos;expert archer&apos;) which replace weapon training and do not otherwise refer to the weapon training ability. Therefore, this ability does not count as weapon training for abilities that improve weapon training (such as gloves of dueling). This is the case even for the &apos;expert archer,&apos; ability which has a bonus that improves every 4 fighter levels, exactly like weapon training.</p>

			<p>Boar Style seems to deal 2d6 bleed damage, which by the normal rules of bleed damage would apply each round, but then Boar Shred, which requires Boar Style and a much higher level, deals 1d6 bleed damage and specifies that it happens on each round. Did Boar Style mean something else?</p>

		<Benefit>
			<p>You can create special wondrous items&#x2014;typically barbs, hooks, rings, and spikes&#x2014;that adorn piercings in the wearer&apos;s flesh and grant magical abilities. Both you and the recipient of the piercing (if not yourself) must be present for the entire piercing process.</p>
			<p>Shadow piercings must be placed in a part of the body normally associated with a magic item slot, but they do not take up a slot on the body, nor interfere with other magic items that use those slots. A single slot can only hold one shadow piercing (non-magical piercings do not count against this limit). Shadow piercings can be applied to the following slots: belt, body, chest, eyes, feet, hands, head, neck, shoulder, and wrist.A single slot can hold multiple physical piercings, though the pieces of jewelry operate as a single item and must be created for that purpose. Shadow piercings have different levels of power: minor, major, and greater. Minor shadow piercings usually include one piece of jewelry, while major and greater shadow piercings often are made up of multiple rings and spikes that cover the entire area of the piercing&apos;s slot (but are still considered a single item). A creature can only use a number of shadow piercings equal its Constitution modifier plus its Wisdom modifier.Carefully inserting or removing a shadow piercing takes a full-round action and deals no damage. Alternatively, a shadow piercing may be pulled out of a creature using the steal maneuver as a standard action that deals 1d6 points of damage. Only a creature with the Craft Shadow Piercing feat may create or insert a shadow piercing, but any creature may remove one. Inserting a shadow piercing is impossible unless the target is willing or helpless. After being removed, a shadow piercing may be inserted into another creature by someone with this feat. Since they are treated as magic items, they are affected by dispel magic.Shadow piercings follow the rules for magic item creation, except the creator can use the Craft (jewelry) skill instead of Spellcraft. New shadow piercings can be researched and designed using the rules for pricing new magic items. Shadow piercing powers for a specific slot must be thematically similar or linked. Since shadow piercings don&apos;t interfere with other magic items in the same slot, but can only have one piercing per slot, the base price is multiplied by 1.5 instead of doubled as if they had no space limitation.</p>
