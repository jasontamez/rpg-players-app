# rpg-players-app

An attempt at making an app for struggling players in my Pathfinder campaigns, with a focus on making it simple for other RPGs to be supported.

## Currently

Moving from an XML-based approach to a JSON-based approach.

The last pre-JSON version is still available as a separate branch.
